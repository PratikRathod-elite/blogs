        <h1>Anxiety : Can we Find a Cure?</h1>
        <h3>-Sameera S Vasista-</h3>
        <p>
          <span>A</span>nxiety does not come from thinking about the future but occurs from
          the thought of controlling it. <strong>Tempers are frayed</strong> and
          it is just an alarming response to what awaits you in the future.
          Experts call it an instinctive reaction to stress, which is something
          similar to peopleâ€™s first job interview. One must be aware that if
          anxiety condition persists for a very long time, say around six
          months, then it'll be termed as an anxiety disorder in medical terms,
          which is very dangerous for an individual's well-being.

                That shifts the focus back to the thought, is anxiety bad? not really.
                The thought of taking huge responsibilities may seem
                <strong>irksome</strong> to begin with, but it drives you to work
                harder and finer. The feeling of constant fear can be lethal and
                <strong>weakening</strong> which may stop you from indulging in
                activities that you love, the worst-case scenario being the fear of
                not leaving home. Anxiety disorders are closely related to emotional
                disorders which are commonly seen in people of all ages.
                <strong>The American Psychiatric Association</strong> in their report
                mentioned that women are more likely to be suffering from anxiety
                disorders than men. A few important anxiety disorders are :
              </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Phobias</li>
          <li>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</li>
          <li>Panic disorders</li>
          <li>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We routinely contemplate what causes anxiety disorders, but the
          researchers are still not aware of the exact cause, but what they are
          certain about is, it has something to do with
          <strong>genetic, environmental factors, and brain chemistry</strong>.
          Common symptoms include dry mouth, sweating, fear, distress, numbness
          to name a few. One thing that makes anxiety disorders dangerous is
          that diagnosis of this disorder is an extensive process that includes
          physical, mental, and psychological tests. The doctors use several
          parameters to assess the level of anxiety. Now we can interpret and
          explore the course of options if a person is diagnosed with anxiety.
          In most cases, medical treatment can be avoided and a few changes in
          the <strong>style of living</strong> would suffice to tackle the
          disorder, but in extreme cases, medical interventions seem necessary.
          Regular appointments with your therapist or psychologist can help you
          overcome the inevitable.

                Nature itself is the best physician and natural caretaker of the body.
                Meditation, healthy eating habits, avoiding alcohol- cigarettes,
                getting enough sleep will help you get rid of anxiety issues. Anxiety
                attacks can be an outcome of vital depression, which can be fatal in
                children and teens.

                  >Uncontrolled anxiety in teens may lead to them taking extreme
                  steps.</strong

          Stress and anxieties fall under the
          <strong>same umbrella</strong> which arises because of the demands of
          the brain and the body. As discussed before neither of them are bad,
          it is like a motivation which one should not expect to persevere for
          long. People think alcohol and drugs can help you settle your nerves,
          but less they know that it can unsettle the routine of the brain,
          which is far more dangerous.
          <strong>Why dive into another problem to solve one?</strong> After
          all, anxieties can be managed and treated.
